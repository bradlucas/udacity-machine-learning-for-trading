** 03-01 - How Machine Learning is used at a hedge fund
Building models

*** The ML problem

x -> Model -> y

Observation -> Model -> Prediction

Data -> ML -> Model

*** What's X and Y

Future price or return are predictions

*** Supervised Regression Learning

Supervised
Provide examples of x and y

Regression
Numerical approximation or prediction

Learning
Training with data


- Linear regression (parametric)
  - Finds the parameters for a model

- K nearest neighbor (KNN) (instance based)
  - Instance based because the data is kept from the training and consulted

- Decision trees
  - Query goes through the tree. Each node is a question. Reach a leave which is the regression value which is returned

- Decision forests
  - Collections of trees
