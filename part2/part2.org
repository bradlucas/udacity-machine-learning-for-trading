There are ten secions in Part 2

* 02-01 - So you want to be a hedge fund manager
MC2: Computational Investing

Lessons: In this mini-course, we focus on modeling the behavior of stock markets.
- So you want to be a hedge fund manager?
- Market mechanics
- What is a company worth?
- The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM)
- How hedge funds use the CAPM
- Technical Analysis
- Dealing with data
- Efficient Markets Hypothesis
- The Fundamental Law of active portfolio management
- Portfolio optimization and the efficient frontier

Projects:
- Build a market simulator
- Invent your own technical indicator
- Write a strategy that generates orders

** Types of funds
- ETF
  - Electronically Traded Fund
  - Buy/Sell like stocks
  - Baskets of stocks
  - Transparent

- Mutual Funds
  - Buy/Sell at end of day
  - Quarterly disclosure
  - Less transparent

- Hedge Funds
  - Buy/sell by agreement
  - No disclosure
  - Not transparent

** Liquidity and capitalizatio

Liquid
How easy you can buy and sell

Capitalization
How much is the company worth using the formula # Shares * Price


Symbols
Mutual Funds have 5 letters
ETFs have 4 or 3 letters

** Incentives for fund managers

Assets Under Management (AUM)

ETF
Expense Ratio
Percentage of AUM
0.01% (1 bip)
1.00% is high

Mutual Fund
Expense Ratio of AUM
0.5% to 3.00%

Hedge Funds
Two and Twenty
2% of AUM + 20% of profits

** Two and Twenty

Example
Fund's assets under management is 100,000,00
It grows to 115M
15% return

2% of 100M = 2M
20% of 15M = 3M
Total = 5M


Lately, Hedge Funds are typically lower. Example, 1 and 10

SAC -> 4 and 40

** How funds attract investors

Hedge Funds can only have 100 investors

Who?
- Individuals
- Instititutions
- Funds of funds

Why?
- Track record (typically 5 years of history)
- Simulation and story
- Good portfolio fit

** Hedge fund goals and metrics

Goals
- Beat a benchmark (SP500 for example)
- Absolute return (Long/Short)

Metrics
- Cumulative Return = (Val[-1]/Val[0]) - 1
- Volatility = daily_rets.std()   "standard deviation of daily returns"
- Risk/Reward or Sharpe Ratio =  sqrt(252) * mean(daily_rets - rf) / daily_rets.std         "Ratio risk to reward, Risk adjusted reward"
                                 sqrt(trading days of year) * reward / risk

| Target Portfolio      |                   | Live Portfolio |        |
|-----------------------+-------------------+----------------+--------|


The Trading Algorithm tries to get Live Portfolio to match a Target portfolio
You don't want to excute every thing at once else you might move the market against yourself

* 02-02 - Market Mechanics
** What is in an order?

- Buy/Sell
- Symbol
- # Shares
- Limit or Market
- Price

The Order book
- Each exchange keeps and order book

|---------+--------+------|
| BID/ASK |  PRICE | SIZE |
|---------+--------+------|
| ASK     | 100.10 |  100 |
| ASK     | 100.05 |  500 |
| ASK     | 100.00 | 1000 |
| BID     |  99.95 |  100 |
| BID     |  99.90 |   50 |
| BID     |  99.85 |   50 |
|---------+--------+------|

BID == Buyer
ASK == Seller

ORDEr
BUY,IBM,100,LIMIT,99.95
SELL,IBM,1000,LIMIT,100

BUY,IBM,100,MARKET

** Hedge Fund

Exploiting market mechanics

Order book exploit
Colocate next to exchange and view the exchange's order book before remote buyers and sellers
Acting before orders that arrive later

Geographic Arbitrage Exploit
Exhanges are located far apart (NYSE and London)
Colocated in both exchanges with ultra-high speed connection between
Notice differences between the exchanges


** Additional Order Types

Exchanges
- Buy/Sell
- Market/Limit

Broker
Other types are implemented by the Broker
- Stop loss
  - Sell when stock falls to a specific value
- Stop gain
  - Sell when stock reaches
- Trailing stop
  - Stop loss that changes
- Selling short

** Short Selling

You borrow 100 shares and sell them to someone else and you get the selling price
You have the purchase amount but you owe the owner of the shares

You might have to give the shares back early

You are hoping that the value of the shares goes down
If it does then you can buy the shares for less, give back the shares you own and pocket the difference

** Short selling : Exit

You guy at 90 from someone else
Give back the 100 shares
Your profit is the original 100 price you paid less the 90 you paid to get the shares to give them back

** What can go wrong?

What if the price goes up?
You have to pay more to give back the shares. You lose that difference.
